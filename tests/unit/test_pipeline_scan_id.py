"""Regression: run_scan must UPDATE the scan id it was given (created by
POST /scans) instead of minting a new one. Before the fix the pipeline always
called uuid4(), so the requested scan stayed `pending` forever and the UI was
stuck on a scan that never progressed (results landed under a different id)."""
